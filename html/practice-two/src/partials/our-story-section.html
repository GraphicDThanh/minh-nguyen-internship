          <p>
            Hi! We are Tom & Kay — two passionate engineers of user experience.
            Building things people want makes us happy!
          </p>
          <p>
            Kay is a former Googler and Tom is a startup veteran. We started
            VanGoux because it didn’t make sense to us that UI designs needed to
            be recreated in code from scratch.
